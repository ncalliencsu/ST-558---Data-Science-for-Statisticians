## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

### 3rd Level Header

#### 4th Level Header

Let's create a histogram of the iris data set.

```{r}
hist (iris$Sepal.Length)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
